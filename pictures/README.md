These are photos about my setup.

Please note that the CPU is fake R6502, in fact it is a W65C02 (under the hood). It is a CMOS variant of the 6502 CPU, that is why there is the pullup resistor under
the IC socket.

Currently there is potmeter instead of R5, it is to be replaced with a 620R resistor.

No keyboard attached yet, C and B and <RETURN> were entered by connecting momentarily the proper lines in the keyboard socket.
